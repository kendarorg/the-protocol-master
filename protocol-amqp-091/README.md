# AMQP 0.9.1 Protocol

Create a two way transparent proxy to a remote amqp 0.9.1 compatible server.

## Configuration

* protocol: amqp091 (this is mandatory)
* port: the port on which the proxy will listen
* login: the -real- login to use to connect to the real server
* password: the -real- password to use to connect to the real server
* connectionString: the connection string for the real server (e.g. amqp://localhost:5372 )
* timeoutSeconds: the timeout to drop the connections
* ignoreTrivialCalls: all calls must be present
* blockExternal: if a call is not matched then try to use the real connection

## Plugins

### record-plugin

The data will be stored in the global dataDir.

All callback are recorded

* active: If it is active
* ignoreTrivialCalls: store in full only calls that cannot be generated automatically (the ones with real data)
* resetConnectionsOnStart: reset connection on start replaying. When starting replay on an already active server (
  default true)

### replay-plugin

The data will be loaded from the global dataDir. This is used to replay a whole flow
without the need to mock a single request

All callback are replayed automatically

* active: If it is active
* respectCallDuration: respect the duration of the round trip
* resetConnectionsOnStart: reset connection on start replaying. When starting replay on an already active server (
  default true)
* blockExternal: Block calls to real service when not matching (default true)

### publish-plugin

* Always active
* Exposes the API to retrieve the current connections and if they are subscribed to something
* Exposes the API to send a message to a currently active connection
