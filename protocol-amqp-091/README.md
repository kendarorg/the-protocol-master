# AMQP 0.9.1 Protocol

Create a two-way transparent proxy to a remote amqp 0.9.1 compatible server.

## Configuration

* protocol: amqp091 (this is mandatory)
* port: the port on which the proxy will listen
* login: the -real- login to use to connect to the real server
* password: the -real- password to use to connect to the real server
* connectionString: the connection string for the real server (e.g. amqp://localhost:5372 )
* timeoutSeconds: the timeout to drop the connections
* ignoreTrivialCalls: all calls must be present
* blockExternal: if a call is not matched then try to use the real connection

Uses the following phases

* PRE_CALL (Before calling the real server)
* POST_CALL
* PRE_SOCKET_WRITE (Before sending data to the client)
* ASYNC_RESPONSE (When receiving push data from the server)

## Plugins

### record-plugin

The data will be stored in the global dataDir.

All callback are recorded

* active: If it is active
* ignoreTrivialCalls: store in full only calls that cannot be generated automatically (the ones with real data)
* resetConnectionsOnStart: reset connection on start replaying. When starting replay on an already active server (
  default true)

### replay-plugin

The data will be loaded from the global dataDir. This is used to replay a whole flow
without the need to mock a single request

All callback are replayed automatically

* active: If it is active
* respectCallDuration: respect the duration of the round trip
* resetConnectionsOnStart: reset connection on start replaying. When starting replay on an already active server (
  default true)
* blockExternal: Block calls to real service when not matching (default true)

### publish-plugin

Exposes two APIs
* Retrieve the current connections and if they are subscribed to something
* Send a message to a currently active connection

* active: If it is active

### report-plugin

Send all activity on the internal events queue (the default subscriber if active is the global-report-plugin)

* active: If it is active

### network-error-plugin

Change random bytes on the data sent back to the client

* active: If it is active
* percentAction: the percent of calls to generate errors

### latency-plugin

Introduce random latency. Not applicable to async calls

* active: If it is active
* minMs: Minimum latency added (default 0)
* maxMs: Max latency added (default 0)

## Weirdness

* amqp0-9-1.pdf, section 4.2.3, The size is an INTEGER not a long
* Actually transactions are not supported
